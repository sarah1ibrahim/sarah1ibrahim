### 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m a **Biomedical Engineering graduate from Cairo University** with a strong focus on **medical technologies** and **digital healthcare transformation**. Throughout my academic and personal projects, I’ve worked extensively with **medical imaging**, particularly modalities such as **MRI**, **CT**, and **X-ray**, exploring how they can be enhanced through **software-driven solutions**.

My recent experience includes developing both **web-based platforms** and **desktop applications** that integrate with **AI-powered medical tools**. These solutions enable advanced capabilities such as **diagnostic support**, **image processing**, and efficient **clinical workflow integration**. I contribute to the **design, development, and deployment** of these systems to ensure practical and scalable outcomes.
